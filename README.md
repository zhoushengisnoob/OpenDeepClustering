## About
Hello :wave:, we are a team of researchers from the Eagle-Lab (InnovativE SoftwAre TechnoloGy DeveLopment CentEr), Zhejiang University. Here are two questions and answers that embody the essence of our mission for this repository.
### What is clustering task?
The primary purpose of clustering is to assign the instances into groups so that the similar samples belong to the same cluster while dissimilar samples belong to different clusters.
### Why deep clustering?
Although shallow clustering methods like KMeans have achieved tremendous success, they can no longer be directly applied to deal with high-dimension or complicated unstructured data like images. 

Deep Clustering, which aims at joint optimization of deep representation learning and clustering, arises and has attracted increasing attention recently in the community.


## Installation
Step-1, clone this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/zhoushengisnoob/OpenDeepClustering.git
cd OpenDeepClustering
```

Step-2, create a new conda environment and download the dependencies.
```
conda create -n deepclustering python=3.10 -y
conda activate deepclustering
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸš€Quick start


Third, run the code. Take the DEC as a example.
```
python 
```
